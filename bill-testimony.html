			<h2>What is being a Computer Science Major Like?</h2>
			<p>
				Being a CS major has been a lot about learning how to learn. Most classes are about getting a look at
				different topics and subtopics. It has been about expanding on what you know and what you know you don't
				know.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although it is possible to learn everything on your own and do everything by yourself, I found more
				enjoyment in collaborating with other students. Meeting others in open labs and finding people to work
				through problems with made my experience better and prepared me for collaboration  that is present in the
				industry.
