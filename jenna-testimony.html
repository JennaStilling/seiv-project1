                        <br>
                        <p>In all seriousness, though, computer science has been a fun ride. I entered this major with
                            no prior experience in coding outside of some basic web development tutorials from Khan
                            Academy, and I instantly fell in love with the problem-solving nature of the major. Computer
                            science as a field challenges you to think outside of the box daily and learn to collaborate
                            with others daily to accomplish tasks and finish projects. With this degree, I've been
                            exposed to a wide variety of topics in the field I never would have considered working in,
                            such as web development and algorithmtic theory.</p>
                        <p>My favorite part of this four-year journey has been the work I've been able to accomplish in
                            game development. Learning to work with others and create games has been a huge highlight of
                            my time in college, and I've been able to step into several leadership roles and attend
                            conferences such as the national Game Developer's Conference and Industry Giants as a
                            result. I've become very close to several of my teammates throughout game jams and class
                            projects, and I feel right at home working with them to create games. Whether or not those
                            games get finished, I am always learning something new and improving my craft.</p>
                        <p>In this field, you are exposed to a wide variety of individuals with varying amounts of
                            skill, and I am always pushed to be a better person and improve my own skills to keep up.
                            Communication, teamwork, and a strong work ethic are key skills to have in this field, but
                            once you have those, everything else can be taught.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Best of luck, and I hope to work alongside you one day!</p>
