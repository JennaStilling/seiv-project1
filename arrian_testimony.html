                            <p>Computer Science allows me to be creative logically and technically. I can solve problems 
                                using a process while also having the freedom to design the solution as I wish, which is fun!
                            </p>
                            <p>Computer Science as a job is also more of what I look for in a job benefits-wise. I can work
                                from home, have flexible hours, and can change what industry I work in! It definitely keeps
                                on my toes.
                            </p>
                            <p>In this field, you interact with a diverse range of individuals with different skill levels, 
                                constantly challenging me to grow both personally and professionally. While communication, 
                                teamwork, and a strong work ethic are essential, once you possess these qualities, the rest 
                                can be learned along the way.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Hopefully, this along with our other testimonies helps you in informing you about what C.S. is like!</p>
