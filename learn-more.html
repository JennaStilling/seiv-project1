          <p id="desc-text">The most important thing to remember when deciding if you want to pursue computer science as
            a degree is that you don't need any experience going into college. You will learn everything you need to
            know in classes, and through fellow peers and professors that will equip you with the knowledge to enter the
            field. If you think you are ready to take the next step, wherever you are in your development career, feel
            free to check out some of the universities in Oklahoma listed below. Each of these programs have been
            carefully designed to challenge you to be the best you can be and have a wonderful team of professors to
            guide you along your way.</p>
