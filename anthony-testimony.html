				<h2>What is being a Computer Science Major Like?</h2>
				<p>It's a lot problem solving, you are given a problem and have to come up with a solution using what
					you have.</p>
				<p>I've always thought of it like a puzzle you see in video games. </p>
				<p>What's the problem? What's suppose to happen? And what do you have?</p>
				<br>
				<p>Having good communication and teamwork skills is important.</p>
				<p>There will be a lot of times where you will be working in teams, especially when you join the work
					force.</p>
				<br>
				<p>You also meet a lot of people who have similar interests as you. I've made a lot of new friends from
					my time here at OC as well as my internship.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Overall, I have no regrets about choosing computer science as my major. Its been a fun few years with
					plenty of challenges and new experiences.</p>
